# Strava-fitness-project
This project aimed to analyze user fitness and health behavior using comprehensive data collected from STRAVA. Strava is an American internet service for tracking physical exercise which incorporates social network features.Strava records data for a user's activities, which can then be shared with the user's followers or shared publicly. An activity's recorded information may include a route summary, elevation (net and unidirectional), speed (average and maximum), timing (total and moving time), power and heart rate.

A total of 18 distinct datasets were used, each covering various aspects of user health, including daily activity, sleep patterns, calories burned, steps taken, sedentary time, weight logs, and BMI. These datasets were integrated and analyzed using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and stored in a SQLite database for efficient querying and management. The analysis involved data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and categorization.
